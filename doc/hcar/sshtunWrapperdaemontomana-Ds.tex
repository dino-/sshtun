\label{sshtun}
\report{Dino Morelli}%05/12
\status{experimental, actively developed}
\makeheader

This is a daemon that executes an ssh command to form a secure tunnel and then blocks on it. If the tunnel goes down, sshtun can attempt to reestablish it. It can also be set up to monitor a file on an http server to determine if the tunnel should be up or not, so you can switch it on or off remotely.

sshtun is available from Hackage and the Darcs repository below.
